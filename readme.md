# Bash Brew Service
A set of bash scripts to take some of the pain away from managing homebrew processes with launchctl on OSX.

### Installation
Bash Brew Service comes with an installation script, called install.sh. For manual installation, copy all of the `service*` scripts to a directory in your `$PATH` and make them executable with `chmod u+x [script]`.

```
cd /path/to/bash/brew/service
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Files
`service [load/unload] [servicename]`

* Starts (load) or stops (unload) a service you previously installed.

`service-install [name] [plistfile]`

* Links a plist file installed by a homebrew application to an arbitrary name in your `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory for easy loading and unloading. Installed services will also start on login unless you disable them manually.

`service-remove [name]`

* Removes the link to the homebrew application plist file from `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

`service-list`

* Lists all services installed with `service-install`. Unfortunately there is no way to differentiate which scripts are currently running without a large amount of bash magic that I haven't had the time to complete yet.

### Uninstalling
If you used the `install.sh` script Simply delete `~/.bin/brew-service`

### Usage

```
$ brew install redis
$ service-install redis /usr/local/Cellar/redis/2.8.17/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
$ service-list
redis
$ service redis load
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> exit
$ service redis unload
$ redis-cli
Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused
$ service-remove redis
$ service-list
$ exit
```
